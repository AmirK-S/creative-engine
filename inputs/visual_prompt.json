  "full_creative_description": "Square canvas divided 60:40. Left 60%: Bright, sun-lit kitchen interior. A smiling woman in active-wear (match client avatar) holds a vertical stack of three NutraGlow “GlowTonic” jars (top peach, middle teal, bottom lavender) centred at mid-torso, angled slightly toward camera. Camera: waist-up, eye-level, shallow depth for soft background blur; jars sharp and heroed. A star-burst discount badge (“UP TO 50% OFF”) overlaps the extreme top-left corner of the frame. Right 40%: Solid brand-teal panel (#009688). • Top of panel: bold sun-gold (#FFB300) headline “TUMMY TONE BY SUMMER”. • Directly below: white sub-headline “90-DAY RITUAL TO BURN FAT & GLOW”. • Beneath: five benefit bullets in white text, each led by a large teal-lime check icon: 1) Melt fat while you rest 2) Control cravings naturally 3) Target stubborn zones 4) Steady, crash-free energy 5) Collagen boost for hair, skin & nails. • Lower-mid panel: circular ribbon badge (lavender outline + white fill) containing “90 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE 100%”. • To its right: green text block “90 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE”. • Bottom-right: Afterpay logo (brand-approved monochrome) followed by green CTA “BUY NOW, PAY LATER”. Maintain original reading flow: badge → headline → subhead → checklist → guarantee → CTA. Keep typography hierarchy identical, swap colours to brand palette only. Generate a visually similar static ad using the client’s brand visuals, colours, and typography while preserving this concept and structure."
